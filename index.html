    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_whatis">What is FascistValues?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_p_answer">FascistValues is a fascist quiz inspired by and based upon the <a
            href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a> quiz that says you what of the many branches of 
			the fascism you belong, considering fascism simply as an authoritarian, third-positionist
			ideology. This test is only for fascists, if you're not, this test isn't made for you. At the
			end of the question, you can watch your position respect several matters.<br /><br />
        There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_whatvalues">What are the values?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_sixaxes">There are currently seven axes, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_rev_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#BC2532;">Left</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#6DAF79;">Right</b><br />
        In the economic axis, the right usually puts more focus on private property and companies and more 
		moderate changes on the capitalist economy, for example, the first years of the Mussolini's Italy. While
		the left usually will put more effort on the working class, encouraging the trade unions, and an almost
		total planification of the economy, like the National-Syndicalists or the Strasserist. All of these ones
		always inside the third positionist economy.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_sci_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#515151;">Totalitarian</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#C1C1C1;">Moderate</b><br />
        In the government axis, the totalitarians usually tend to establish and state what is above all, with a 
		supreme leader who is object of cult and with infallible law enforcement, like the totalitarian regime in
		the Nazi Germany. The moderates, while also promoting a strong state, often agree with the freedom of
		speech and press, even sometimes they include systems of partial democracy as the organic democracy.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_cent_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#9E281F;">Race</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#4968C6;">Culture</b><br />
        In the identity axis, those who set above the race, they give it more importance, and their goals are often to unite
		all their peoples under the same state, they also usually opposed to the inmigration, for 
		example, the Nazi Germany again. Those who set above the culture usually seek to preserve the national
		values and culture of their country, while are also opposed	to multiculturalism, as they expect inmigrants 
		to integrate, like the falangists in Spain.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_int_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#A5528E;">Pacifist</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#B7632C;">Militarist</b><br />
        In the military axis, the pacifists usually want to keep peace to ensure the prosperity of their nation,
		they see a military conflict as an innecesary loss of both money and human lives, for example, the British
		Fascists of Oswald Mosley. The militarists, usually want to start a war to retake the "former glory" of their
		countries, they see the war as the only way to achieve their national goals, for example, the Mussolini's Italy.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_party_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#2C9E92;">Religion</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#7DBC34;">Secular</b><br />
        In the religious axis, the religious often want to establish a strong religious identity based on the traditional
		religion, maybe with the reunification of church and state, like the clerical fascist. The secularist, want to remove the
		traditional religion away from the state, sometimes to establish a fully secular state, like the British fascists, and othertimes
		to establish a new pagan/esoteric religion, like the SchutStaffel(SS) in Germany.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_prod_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#804E00;">Production</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#586808;">Nature</b><br />
        In the acceleration axis, those who set above the production, want to boster the productivity of their country
		at any coast, even if this causes damage to the nature. While those who set above the nature, want to keep nature 
		at any coast, sometimes even wanting to go back to a pre-industrial life style, like the Eco-Fascists.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_cons_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#27577A;">Reactionary</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#45C147;">Progressive</b><br />
        In the social axis, the reactionaries tend to keep the traditions and hierarchies, they are strongly opposed
		to the modern course of the society, like the Integralists or the Clerical fascists. The progressives want 
		to trigger some social changes, and one day they could be considered as revolutionaries, like the falangists and
		strasserists in their times, and the homofacism or the stransserism nowadays.</p>
    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_closest">What does "Closest Match" mean in the results?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_p_similar">Similar to 8values, this quiz will attempt to match you with a specific leftist
        ideology. There are currently twelve possible ideologies, with more to come in the future. This is a work in
        progress and may not work as intended. Suggestions are very welcome. The current ideologies are:
        Italian Fascism, National-Socialism, British Fascism, Falangism, Esoteric Fascism, Integralism,
        Clerical Fascism, Eco-Fascism, Strasserism, Homofascism, Silver Legionism and Black Hundredism.</p>
    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_scores">I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_p_scores">Please remember that you are not intended to get a 100% score in any of the
        categories. The point of the quiz is to challenge your views. If you have any suggestions or constructive
        criticism please open an issue onthe <a href="https://github.com/fascistvalues/fascistvalues.github.io">GitHub Page</a>.</p>
